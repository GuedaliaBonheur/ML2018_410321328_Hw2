<h3 align="center">Handwritten Character Recognition</h3>
<h4 align="center">Description</h4>
The goal of this assignment was to implement a handwritten character recognition system, based on the MNIST dataset.
Our Implementation was done in MatLab, using the neural network algorithm. Our algorithm finds out by himself which pixels in an image are important feature in distinguishing the digits and put more weightings into those pixels, making them more recognizable.
As input data we used binary images of handwritten digits from the MNIST database, which have a size of 28 x 28pixels
